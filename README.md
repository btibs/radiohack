# Chiptune DJ

This repository contains code for playing various tunes through a repurposed radio, controlled by a calculator.  The radio we used has potentiometers controlling the frequency and volume, which we use to alter the frequency and speed of the songs being played.

Songs are thanks to some other open source code:

* [Mario themes](http://www.princetronics.com/supermariothemesong/)
* [Nyan cat, Tetris](https://github.com/electricmango/Arduino-Music-Project)
* [Star Wars themes](http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i262/s13/content/mariespliid/lab-5-star-wars-song-selector)
* [Various others](http://arduinomelodies.blogspot.com/)

"songlib" contains the code for the radio half, and "ReadCalculator for interfacing with the calculator buttons.
